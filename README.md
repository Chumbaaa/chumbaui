**ChumbaUI** is a DelvUI profile made for 4k resolution players with a eye-friendly color scheme using Catpuccin's Latte [palette](https://catppuccin.com/).

I had a few **design goals** in mind while making this profile:
+ Remove clutter from the center of the screen.
+ Keeping the most important information legible and obvious at-a-glance.
+ A single profile that is usable for all roles and content.

I also had a few **aesthetic principles**:
+ Use Catpuccin's Latte palette because it's beautiful.
+ Use FFXIV's native "Axis" font wherever possible.
+ Use job colors wherever appropriate. (I did not edit job colors outside of DRG for legibility)
+ Symmetry with a special focus on spacing from the center of the screen.

**Installation**

Import string found [here](https://github.com/Chumbaaa/chumbaui/blob/main/Import). I'd recommend making a new profile with it.
Customize to your liking, and enjoy!

**TODO:**

+ Synchronize sizes among job bars to be overall larger and more legible
+ DelvCD for all classes
+ General cleanup and much more testing
